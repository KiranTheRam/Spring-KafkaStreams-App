# Spring-KafkaStreams-App
Scrapes domains given a search parameter, sends it to a Kafka topic. Then finds which ones are active, and sends them to a new topic.

## Important
Because I suck at using git from within Intellij here is how u pull and use the project:
1. Pull the master, DomainProcessor, and DomainService branches
2. Set them up each in their own projects
3. Run them
